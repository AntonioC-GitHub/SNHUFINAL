Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game Draw it or Lose it which is currently only on Android. In Draw it or Lose it the user sees images rendered at 30 second intervals
- If the team does not guess the puzzle before time is up the reamining teams have the ability to offer one guess to solve the puzzle within 15 seconds.
- They requested the following software to be designed:
- a game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved
- each team will have multiple players assigned to it
- Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name
- Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- I researched the best methods of developing their software to meet the needs of the client by offering expertise in server development, an operating
- system to develop the code on and also found the most cost effective way to build their needs.


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- Working through a design document really helps you figure out everything you need to develop the project successfully for the client
- it helped me realize what the clients needs were and how to build out their project to the best of my ability to make sure it met all their needs and wants.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
